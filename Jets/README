To setup the N-subjetiness code in CMSSW_7_0_X, follow the following steps:

### Copy the fastjet-contrib files to the SCRAM toolbox
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
cp $CMSSW_BASE/src/ExoDiBosonResonances/EDBRJets/tools/* $CMSSW_BASE/config/toolbox/$SCRAM_ARCH/tools/selected/

### Tell SCRAM that those tools are going to be setup
scram setup fastjet-contrib
scram setup fastjet-contrib-archive

### Rebuild everything
scram b -j 8
